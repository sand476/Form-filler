## üìù How to Add Module-Based Questions with Sub-Questions

### Understanding the Structure
The system supports module-based questions where each module has:
- **Main Question**: The primary question
- **3 Sub-Questions**: Specific aspects to address

### Method 1: Simple Module Questions (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Plan Your Modules
Decide on your modules, for example:
- **Module 1**: Leadership Skills (Q101-Q103)
- **Module 2**: Problem Solving (Q104-Q106)
- **Module 3**: Communication (Q107-Q109)
- **Module 4**: Teamwork (Q110-Q112)

#### Step 2: Create Questions
For each module, create 3 related questions:

**Example - Leadership Module:**
```javascript
'Q101': 'Describe your leadership style and how it has evolved over time.',
'Q102': 'What leadership challenges have you faced and how did you overcome them?',
'Q103': 'How do you motivate and inspire team members to achieve their best?'
```

**Example - Problem Solving Module:**
```javascript
'Q104': 'Walk us through a complex problem you solved step by step.',
'Q105': 'How do you approach problems when you don\'t have all the information?',
'Q106': 'Describe a time when your initial solution failed and how you adapted.'
```

### Method 2: Advanced Module Structure with Sub-Questions

#### Step 1: Create Module-Based Question Format
Modify the questions to include sub-questions within each main question:

**Example Structure:**
```javascript
'Q101': 'Leadership Assessment: Please address the following aspects of your leadership experience: 1) Your leadership philosophy and style, 2) A challenging leadership situation you handled, 3) How you develop and mentor team members.',
'Q102': 'Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your problem-solving methodology covering: 1) How you analyze and break down complex problems, 2) Your decision-making process under pressure, 3) How you learn from failed solutions.',
'Q103': 'Communication Skills: Explain your communication effectiveness in: 1) Presenting ideas to senior management, 2) Resolving conflicts between team members, 3) Adapting communication style for different audiences.'
```

#### Step 2: Update Answer Labels
You can customize the answer labels to match your sub-questions:

**In the HTML, change the labels:**
```html
<label for="answer1" class="answer-label">Leadership Philosophy:</label>
<label for="answer2" class="answer-label">Challenging Situation:</label>
<label for="answer3" class="answer-label">Team Development:</label>
```

### Method 3: Dynamic Module System (Advanced)

#### Step 1: Create Module Configuration
Add this to your JavaScript in `index.html`:

```javascript
// Module configuration
const moduleConfig = {
    'LEADERSHIP': {
        name: 'Leadership Assessment',
        questions: {
            'Q101': {
                main: 'Leadership Philosophy and Style',
                sub1: 'Describe your core leadership principles',
                sub2: 'How has your leadership style evolved?',
                sub3: 'What leadership challenges have you overcome?'
            },
            'Q102': {
                main: 'Team Motivation and Development',
                sub1: 'How do you motivate team members?',
                sub2: 'Describe your mentoring approach',
                sub3: 'How do you handle underperforming team members?'
            }
        }
    },
    'PROBLEM_SOLVING': {
        name: 'Problem Solving and Decision Making',
        questions: {
            'Q103': {
                main: 'Complex Problem Analysis',
                sub1: 'How do you break down complex problems?',
                sub2: 'Describe your decision-making process',
                sub3: 'How do you handle uncertainty in problem-solving?'
            }
        }
    }
};
```

#### Step 2: Update the Question Display Function
Replace the `findQuestion()` function with this enhanced version:

```javascript
function findQuestion() {
    const code = questionCodeInput.value.trim().toUpperCase();
    
    if (!code) {
        showError('Please enter a question code.');
        return;
    }

    showLoading(true);
    errorMessage.style.display = 'none';

    setTimeout(() => {
        // Check if it's a module-based question
        const moduleQuestion = findModuleQuestion(code);
        
        if (moduleQuestion) {
            // Display module question with sub-questions
            displayModuleQuestion(moduleQuestion);
        } else {
            // Display regular question
            const question = questionsDatabase[code];
            if (question) {
                questionText.textContent = question;
                questionSection.style.display = 'block';
                thankYou.style.display = 'none';
                questionCodeInput.disabled = true;
                findQuestionBtn.disabled = true;
            } else {
                showError('Question code not found. Please check the code and try again.');
            }
        }
        
        showLoading(false);
    }, 1000);
}

function findModuleQuestion(code) {
    for (const moduleKey in moduleConfig) {
        const module = moduleConfig[moduleKey];
        if (module.questions[code]) {
            return {
                code: code,
                module: module,
                question: module.questions[code]
            };
        }
    }
    return null;
}

function displayModuleQuestion(moduleQuestion) {
    const { code, module, question } = moduleQuestion;
    
    // Update question text
    questionText.innerHTML = `
        <h3>${module.name}</h3>
        <h4>${question.main}</h4>
        <p><strong>Please address the following three aspects:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>${question.sub1}</li>
            <li>${question.sub2}</li>
            <li>${question.sub3}</li>
        </ol>
    `;
    
    // Update answer labels
    document.querySelector('label[for="answer1"]').textContent = question.sub1;
    document.querySelector('label[for="answer2"]').textContent = question.sub2;
    document.querySelector('label[for="answer3"]').textContent = question.sub3;
    
    // Show the question section
    questionSection.style.display = 'block';
    thankYou.style.display = 'none';
    questionCodeInput.disabled = true;
    findQuestionBtn.disabled = true;
}
```
