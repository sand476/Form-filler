    'Q101': 'Proposal: Basic implementation of CIP-0093 in Python

Applicant: Aljosa Mohorovic (Entity ‚Äì Incorporated)
Proposal ID: 0198a48f-b8cc-784e-b3b9-863bc6bffab5
Funding Requested: 25,000 ADA
Duration: 4 months
Theme: Identity & Security ‚Üí Authentication
License: MIT or Apache 2.0

üîπ Problem Statement

Wallets are the main entry point for Cardano dApps.

Most wallets are client-side (browser/mobile).

It‚Äôs difficult to transition existing web apps or prototype new server-side dApps.

üëâ Developers need a way to enable wallet-based authentication for server-side environments.

üîπ Solution Overview

Implement CIP-0093 (Cardano Wallet Authentication Standard) in Python.

Enable server-side development & prototyping with wallet authentication.

Make it easy to build dApps that support ‚ÄúLogin with Cardano‚Äù.

üîπ Project Dependencies

Uses PyCardano library ‚Üí GitHub: Python-Cardano/pycardano
.

üîπ Open Source Commitment

Fully open source.

License: MIT or Apache 2.0 ‚Üí aligns with other Cardano projects, allows both open & commercial usage.

Repository will be public on GitHub.

Features:

Github releases (track progress).

Milestones & issues (track features, bugs, tasks).

Markdown docs (auto-rendered).

GitHub Actions ‚Üí deploy docs to a website.

üîπ Solution Details

Two main goals:

Extend CIP-0093 to another ecosystem (Python).

Bring Python developers (largest dev community) closer to Cardano.

üîπ Impact

Provides easy login/authentication with Cardano wallets during dApp development.

Reduces barriers for new projects ‚Üí quicker prototyping.

Any Python-based project can enable Cardano wallet login easily.

Expected outcome ‚Üí growth of developers & entrepreneurs building on Cardano.

üîπ Feasibility

CIP-0093 is well documented.

Reference implementation exists in JavaScript ‚Üí easy to replicate in Python.

Main effort = focus & time, not technical challenges.

Implemented by senior developer (Aljosa) with product & leadership experience.

üîπ Milestones
Milestone #1 ‚Äì Raw Proof-of-Concept (Month 1)

Deliverable:

GitHub repo with basic, unpolished code.

Working PoC: wallet signs message ‚Üí server authenticates user.

Evidence:

README with replication steps.

Video demo (end-to-end).

Cost: 5,000 ADA

Progress: 40%

Milestone #2 ‚Äì Code Polish, Docs & Examples (Month 2)

Deliverable:

Final organized code.

Developer documentation.

Usage examples (Python frameworks, apps).

Evidence:

Updated video demo.

Documentation walkthrough.

Cost: 10,000 ADA

Progress: 40%

Milestone #3 ‚Äì Final Touches & Close-Out Report (Month 4)

Deliverable:

Final code version.

Developer-focused documentation.

Examples of usage in Python projects.

Catalyst Close-Out Report & final video.

Evidence:

Close-Out report + video walkthrough.

Cost: 10,000 ADA

Progress: 20%

üîπ Budget Breakdown

90% ‚Üí Senior developer‚Äôs work (code + docs + examples).

10% ‚Üí Reporting (text + video).

Total: 25,000 ADA

üîπ Value for Money

Removes a technical obstacle for the largest developer ecosystem (Python).

Developers & entrepreneurs can focus on product innovation instead of wallet integration complexity.

Expected to attract new users & projects to Cardano.

‚úÖ Key Points (Quick Grab)

Proposal: Implement CIP-0093 (wallet authentication) in Python.

Problem: Server-side wallet authentication is hard; current wallets are client-side.

Solution: Python library ‚Üí ‚ÄúLogin with Cardano‚Äù support.

Dependencies: PyCardano.

License: MIT/Apache 2.0, fully open source.

Impact: Easier dApp prototyping, more Python devs on Cardano.

Feasibility: Strong (reference JS implementation exists).

Milestones:

PoC (5k ADA, 40%).

Code polish, docs, examples (10k ADA, 40%).

Final code, docs, close-out report (10k ADA, 20%).

Budget: 25k ADA (mostly dev time).

Value: Lowers barriers for dApp development, grows ecosystem adoption.',
